# SuperCollider Tutorials
The repository for the official SuperCollider online tutorial and reference information. Currently
this is in the early stages of development.

## Get Involved

If you want to get involved then contact us either on the [SuperCollider Forum][forum] or the
[SuperCollider Slack][slack] channel. Any level of involvement is fine. If you want to write a
tutorial by yourself then we won't stop you - equally if all you can do is proof read, or suggest
resources, that's also helpful.

## Tutorial Standards

Documents should have a max line length of 100 columns and be written in markdown.

Code should follow the SuperCollider style guidelines here:
https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/wiki/Code-style-guidelines

We have provided [additional style guidelines](supercollider-style-guidelines.md) specific to this tutorial.

Cookbook entries should address a particular problem that people might run into and show them how
it can be solved. It is perfectly okay to show multiple solutions, but these _must_ be practical
solutions.

## Editing the tutorials

### Requirements

The tutorials are currently built using [mdBook]. On Windows and Linux you just need to download
the binary from their site and update your path so that it points to it. Unfortunately they do not
have a download available for OSX. Fortunately building MDBook is super easy (just follow the
instructions). If for some reason you are unable to build it - then contact me on [Slack][slack]
and I'll send you a binary.

### Build

[mdBook] is a clone of the original [gitbook] and uses [markdown]. So long as you're familiar with
[markdown] then you really shouldn't have any issues as the [mdBook guide] is pretty decent.

Currently there are four tutorials in the src file. The tutorials are built separately (this will
change at some future point). The src code for each book is in ```src/[book-name]```. The html will
be generated in a sub-folder of the ```book``` directory in the root folder.

#### Useful commands

+ ```mdbook build``` - Build the tutorial.
+ ```mdbook build -o``` - Build the tutorial and open it in your default browser.
+ ```mdbook watch``` - Build the tutorial automatically whenever any of the
  files are changed.
+ ```mdbook serve -o``` - Preview the tutorial at ```http:\\localhost:3000```

## Document formatting

The tutorials are written in github's Markdown, which is documented [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
