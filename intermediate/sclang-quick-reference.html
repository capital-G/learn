<p>sclang is not a hard language to pick up if you're familiar with the likes of JavaScript, Python,
Ruby, or Lua. Its object model and syntax are derived from Smalltalk.</p>
<p>We're just going to breeze through sclang basics here. This isn't meant as a complete language spec,
but just enough information so you can get on comfortable footing for writing programs in SC.</p>
<p>Since I'm showing you around a whole gaddang programming language in this chapter, it's going to get
very long and very dull. As such, this probably isn't the most exciting place to start â€” the
beginner's guide is much better if you haven't yet written a line of code. But once you start
writing more complex programs and need a quick reference on how to do basic programming tasks, this
is the chapter for you.</p>
<h2 id="sclang-whats-so-special-about-it"><a class="header" href="#sclang-whats-so-special-about-it">sclang: what's so special about it?</a></h2>
<p>Some programmers come to SuperCollider and are understandably highly skeptical of the idea of
learning a new programming language, especially one that was designed in the 90's. And I won't mince
words with you: sclang is far from perfect. It has aged better than some of its contemporaries in
the computer music sphere, but has some really odd design decisions and long-standing limitations.
Due to server-client separation, others have written clients for SC in Scala, Python, Lua, Haskell,
and many other familiar languages. Why should you bother with sclang?</p>
<p>First off, sclang is "soft real-time safe." sclang isn't under the constraints of an audio thread
like scsynth is, but it does need to sequence events with musically accurate rhythm under normal
conditions, so it is written with features like real-time safe garbage collection. Few interpreted
languages are designed with this in mind (Lua is a major one).</p>
<p>Second, sclang has a feature known as multichannel expansion. These three lines are identical:</p>
<pre><code>// Naive way:
[SinOsc.ar(440), SinOsc.ar(660), SinOsc.ar(880)]

// "Don't Repeat Yourself" way, like in most programming languages:
[440, 660, 880].collect { |freq| SinOsc.ar(freq) };

// Best way, using multichannel expansion:
SinOsc.ar([440, 660, 880])
</code></pre>
<p>Most programming languages would at best offer the second syntax. But the third one is true
idiomatic sclang, and it's more terse and elegant. I know you may be thinking that focusing on
syntax is shallow, but this makes a <em>huge</em> difference when actually working on sound synthesis in
your artistic practice.</p>
<p>I'm not claiming that multichannel expansion as implemented in sclang has been executed perfectly,
but it's still tremendously convenient a lot of the time. Being able to duplicate any part of a
sound synthesis graph easily give sclang an advantage over many other programming languages and
graphical dataflow languages.</p>
<p>Finally, if you are a SuperCollider user, you should be aware that sclang is the #1 SuperCollider
client. By only learning an alternate client, you are distancing yourself from the SC community and
limiting your ability to receive or give help. Most SC users are sclang users, and that's a very
important network effect if you're new to the platform.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong Â­â€” I'm not here to condemn alternate clients and the hard work that goes into
them. I'm sure you'll like some of them better than sclang. But especially for people new to SC,
sclang is strongly recommended.</p>
<h2 id="running-code-in-sclang"><a class="header" href="#running-code-in-sclang">Running code in sclang</a></h2>
<p>For beginning users who come to SC from other languages, the standard method of running code in SC
from the IDE can be pretty weird and offputting. As a refresher, you write SuperCollider code in
<code>.scd</code> files, which have a bunch of code blocks hanging out in space. Rather than running the whole
thing at once, individual lines are run using Shift+Enter, and blocks of code delimited by
parentheses are run using Ctrl+Enter (Cmd+Enter on macOS).</p>
<p>Weird? Yes. But it's less weird once you realize that the <strong>IDE is a glorified REPL</strong>. The workflow
will be familiar if you've ever used Jupyter or an interactive interpreter like Python's. It's just
that REPL is the most common way of interacting with SuperCollider.</p>
<p>It's actually possible â€” and may be preferable â€” to run sclang like an ordinary program from the
command line. This can be done by running</p>
<pre><code>sclang my_file.scd
</code></pre>
<p>and it will work fine. The IDE equivalent is to fire up the interpreter, open up <code>my_file.scd</code>, and
select "Language â†’ Evaluate File."</p>
<p>Your file needs to be set up in a special way, however. The parentheses used to delimit code blocks
for interactive execution will not work as expected, and will usually cause syntax errors. The file
should be a single parenthetical block, although without the enclosing parentheses. By default,
sclang does not exit at the end of file evaluation, so you need to manually run, e.g., <code>0.exit</code> to
quit with return code 0. [TODO: provide an actual example!]</p>
<p>Why use REPL in the IDE if sclang can mostly be run as a normal programming language? Although the
workflow is unusual compared to programming environments, it's not without precedent when viewed as
artistic audio software. In your average modular synth software or hardware, the "work interface"
and the "performance interface" are the same. Same for SC: you write your code and you run your code
in the same place. [TODO: clarify]</p>
<p>One obvious reason to use the IDE is if you incorporate live coding into your work â€” it's a fully
capable live coding interface, and can even be augmented with custom behavior specifically for that
practice. But even if you don't, the IDE provides several user interface benefits, such as showing
you a CPU meter for the server (very important to ensure code is suitable for live performance) and
giving you an easy interface for volume control and recording to disk.</p>
<p>If the whole REPL thing is weird for you, I understand, but I assure you that you will get used to
it. It's all part of SC being live performance software.</p>
<h2 id="comments"><a class="header" href="#comments">Comments</a></h2>
<pre><code class="language-supercollider">// two slashes,

/*
or multiline style.
*/

/* Multiline comments /* DO */ nest. */
</code></pre>
<h2 id="blocks--variables"><a class="header" href="#blocks--variables">Blocks &amp; variables</a></h2>
<p>When you execute code in between parentheses, execute code from a single line,
or execute an entire file, that's a block. The final expression in a block is
its return value. When you execute a block in the IDE, the post window prints
out the block's return value, preceded by a <code>-&gt;</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-supercollider">(
1;
2;
3;
)
// -&gt; 3
</code></pre>
<p>You can declare local variables using <code>var</code>. They're lexically scoped, so they
behave similarly to a lot of your favorite languages.</p>
<pre><code class="language-supercollider">(
var foo = 3, bar;
var baz = 50, quux = foo + baz;
quux;
)
// -&gt; 53
</code></pre>
<p>All <code>var</code> statements have to go at the top of the block, and can't be
interspersed with other code. (I know, it sucks.) An unassigned variable is
given a value of <code>nil</code>.</p>
<p>A variable name always starts with a <em>lowercase</em> Latin letter, then any number
of characters in <code>a-z A-Z 0-9 _</code>. The reserved keywords are quite few:</p>
<pre><code>var arg classvar const pi true false nil inf
</code></pre>
<p>These identifiers are valid variable names, but I wouldn't recommend them,
because then you won't have access to the actual builtins in the local scope:</p>
<pre><code>this super thisProcess thisFunction thisFunctionDef thisMethod thisThread
currentEnvironment topEnvironment
</code></pre>
<p>Assigning to variables outside of <code>var</code> statements is done in the regular C way, like <code>foo = 3;</code>.
Assignments return the assigned value, so they may be chained (<code>foo = bar = 3</code>). Operators like <code>+=</code>
are <em>not</em> supported in the spirit of minimalist Smalltalk syntax.</p>
<p>Variables are scoped to the block they are in, and they cease to exist outside of the block. How do
we share information between blocks then?</p>
<h2 id="environment-variables-and-interpreter-globals"><a class="header" href="#environment-variables-and-interpreter-globals">Environment variables and interpreter globals</a></h2>
<p>sclang doesn't have global variables. Instead, sclang has a syntactic feature known as "environment
variables" (not to be confused with the OS-level environment variables like <code>PATH</code>) that provides a
substitute for global scope. These are notated with the <code>~</code> prefix. In casual conversation, SC users
often refer to them as "tilde variables."</p>
<pre><code class="language-supercollider">~foo = 3;
~foo // -&gt; 3
</code></pre>
<p>These variables persist across blocks. However, what they really supply is <em>dynamic scoping</em>. They
are setting and getting key-value data in a global value called <code>currentEnvironment</code>, which can be
manipulated and changed using various instance and class methods of <code>Environment</code>.</p>
<p>Some people like to use exclusively environment variables to get out of typing <code>var</code>. I don't
recommend it. Local variables have garbage collection and are less prone to mistakes (for example, a
typo'd local variable results in a syntax error, while a typo'd tilde variable returns <code>nil</code>). Only
use environment variables when information needs to be passed between interactively executed blocks.</p>
<p>I lied â€” sclang does actually have global variables, but it has exactly 26 of them: the letters <code>a</code>
through <code>z</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-supercollider">x = 3;
x // -&gt; 3
</code></pre>
<p>I strongly advise against using these in any production code. They're okay when you're doing
nonserious tests, but please don't use them in real compositions.</p>
<p>Note that a single-letter variable declared locally (e.g. <code>var x</code>) isn't global, and just behaves
like any other local variable.</p>
<h2 id="method-calls"><a class="header" href="#method-calls">Method calls</a></h2>
<p>In sclang, pretty much every useful operation is performed by doing method calls on objects. The
object we're calling on is referred to as the <em>receiver</em>, and it can take any number of arguments.
The following are the most common syntaxes for method calls:</p>
<pre><code class="language-supercollider">receiver.doSomething(1, 2, 3);
doSomething(receiver, 1, 2, 3);
</code></pre>
<p>The second one looks like a function call, but it's not. <code>doSomething</code> is actually a method name,
and not referring to any variable in the local scope.</p>
<p>Method calls may take keyword arguments:</p>
<pre><code class="language-supercollider">receiver.doSomething(foo: 1, bar: 2, baz: 3);
</code></pre>
<p>If no arguments are provided, the parentheses may be omitted (as they conventionally are):</p>
<pre><code class="language-supercollider">"Hello World".postln();
"Hello World".postln;
</code></pre>
<p>Users coming from JavaScript, Python, or C++ may be used to <code>.</code> being for attribute retrieval in
addition to method calls. In sclang, attribute getters are just method calls.</p>
<h2 id="mathematics"><a class="header" href="#mathematics">Mathematics</a></h2>
<p>I'm sure you can guess what the <code>nil</code>, <code>true</code>, and <code>false</code> keywords are.
Integers (32-bit signed) and floats (64-bit) are notated in pretty obvious
ways:</p>
<pre><code class="language-supercollider">0 -1 1443 0x07 3.0 4.0 1e8 1e-5
</code></pre>
<p>If a decimal point is provided, there must be at least one digit on each side.
Expressions like <code>.5</code> and <code>3.</code> are syntax errors. This avoids some ambiguous
parses.</p>
<p>Your favorite arithmetic operators work as expected. But unlike many other
languages, <strong>infix operator precedence is always left to right</strong>. The order of
operations is not respected. These are identical:</p>
<pre><code class="language-supercollider">3 + 5 * 4
(3 + 5) * 4
</code></pre>
<p>You're probably groaning right now, but it's internally consistent and not unheard of in language
design. One good reason for it is that sclang supports operator overloading, allowing you to define
your own arbitrary operators like <code>@|@&lt;&gt;@|@</code>. How would we define the order of operations for those?</p>
<p>I expect you'll find these operators useful (they are syntactic sugar for method calls):</p>
<pre><code class="language-supercollider">+ - / * ** == != &lt; &gt; &lt;= &gt;=
</code></pre>
<p><code>/</code> always graduates to a float even if both of its arguments are integers. Same for the
exponentiation operator <code>**</code>.</p>
<p><strong>There is no unary <code>-</code></strong>. When you write <code>-1</code>, it's actually a single token. To do unary negation
on variables and other things that aren't numeric literals, use the <code>neg</code> method.</p>
<p>These are good math functions to have under your belt â€” you can figure them out
easy:</p>
<pre><code class="language-supercollider">asInteger asFloat floor ceil round abs sgn
sin cos tan tanh
</code></pre>
<h2 id="functions"><a class="header" href="#functions">Functions</a></h2>
<p>Functions are denoted with curly braces. They are first-class objects. The
return value is simply the final line, and the function is called using the
<code>.value</code> method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-supercollider">var myFunction = {
    someOtherObject.doSomething;
    3
};
myFunction.value
// -&gt; 3
</code></pre>
<p><code>myFunction.value</code> can be shortened to <code>myFunction.()</code>, but not <code>myFunction()</code>.</p>
<p>Function arguments are denoted using this funky pipe-delimited section:</p>
<pre><code class="language-supercollider">var myFunction = { |foo, bar, baz = 5|
    foo + bar + baz;
};
myFunction.(3, 4);
// -&gt; 12
</code></pre>
<p>There is an older way of writing this: <code>{ arg foo, bar, baz = 5; ... }</code>, but
it's going out of fashion.</p>
<p>Like in JavaScript, functions not strict about variable arguments. Unspecified
arguments with no explicit default value are set to <code>nil</code>. If too many
arguments are provided, they are simply ignored.</p>
<h2 id="conditionals"><a class="header" href="#conditionals">Conditionals</a></h2>
<p>Boolean operators in sclang are a little different from other languages.</p>
<pre><code class="language-supercollider">(0 == 1).not  // -&gt; false

// Equivalent:
true.and(false)
true and: false

// The second is known as "key binary operator" syntax, and can be used in the
// special case where only one argument is passed to the method.

// 'and' and 'or' require their second argument to be wrapped in a function
// for short circuiting to occur:
doThisThing.() or: { doThatThing.() }
</code></pre>
<p>In keeping with sclang's minimal syntax, control structures are just method
calls involving functions.</p>
<pre><code class="language-supercollider">(
if(2 + 2 == 4, {
    "Nice!".postln;
}, {
    "What?".postln;
});
)

// Shortcut syntax that may be used because all arguments are functions.

(
if(2 + 2 == 4) {
    "Nice!".postln;
} {
    "What?".postln;
};
)

// 'if' produces a return value from the function/block that was run, so it
// actually doubles as a ternary operator.
if(2 + 2 == 4, { "Nice" }, { "What" }).postln;

// 'case' is a quick way to write a bunch of nested 'if's. The first condition
// that's true is evaluated.
case
    { x &lt; 0 } { "It's negative".postln; }
    { x &gt; 1000 } { "It's nonnegative, but too big".postln; }
    { x % 2 == 0 } { "It's an even number".postln; };

// 'switch' is very similar to ordinary switch statements. Like 'if' and
// 'case', it passes along the return value of the function that was actually
// evaluated.
switch(thing,
    \option1, { "Option 1" },
    \option2, { "Option 2" }
).postln;

// You can wrap the values in functions â€” saves a few commas.
switch(thing)
    { \option1 } { "Option 1".postln }
    { \option2 } { "Option 2".postln };
</code></pre>
<p>sclang is strict about only Booleans being placed in <code>if</code>, <code>not</code>, <code>and</code>, and
<code>or</code>. If you try something like <code>if(0, ...)</code>, you will receive an error that
says "Non Boolean in test."</p>
<p><code>if</code>, <code>switch</code>, and <code>case</code> are <em>not</em> keywords. They are methods.</p>
<h2 id="arrays"><a class="header" href="#arrays">Arrays</a></h2>
<p>Creation, getting, and setting are the usual. Zero-indexed.</p>
<pre><code class="language-supercollider">(
var myArray = [1, 3, 4, 4, 3];
myArray[0] = myArray[3];
myArray[1] = "hey";
"Array size is %".format(myArray.size).postln;
myArray;
)
// Array size is 5
// -&gt; [ 4, hey, 4, 4, 3 ]

// NOTE: getting and setting indices are actually syntactic sugar for the ".at"
// and ".put" methods.
</code></pre>
<p>Retrieving an out-of-bounds index returns <code>nil</code>. Setting an out-of-bounds index produces an error.</p>
<p>Here are a few useful ways to create arrays:</p>
<pre><code class="language-supercollider">(0..4)    // -&gt; [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ], inclusive of both endpoints
(1,3..10) // -&gt; [ 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 ]
4.dup(8)  // -&gt; [ 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4 ]
{ |i| i ** 2 }.dup(8)   // -&gt; [ 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49 ]
</code></pre>
<p>sclang supports multichannel expansion. Binary and unary operators, when
applied to arrays, are broadcast to the array's elements:</p>
<pre><code class="language-supercolliders">[1, 2, 3, 4] + 4   // -&gt; [ 5, 6, 7, 8 ]
[3, 4, 5] * [1, 6, 8]  // -&gt; [ 3, 24, 40 ]
</code></pre>
<p>This sounds small, but it becomes unbelievably convenient when working with
multichannel sound design.</p>
<p>Appending to arrays is done using the <code>.add</code> method. However, for efficiency
<strong><code>.add</code> may or may not be in place</strong>. To avoid unexpected behavior, always
assign the return value of <code>.add</code> back to the slot for the original array:</p>
<pre><code class="language-supercollider">(
var myArray = [1, 2, 3];
myArray = myArray.add(4);
)
// -&gt; [1, 2, 3, 4]
</code></pre>
<p>Slices are denoted with <code>..</code> and are inclusive of both indices:</p>
<pre><code class="language-supercollider">(
var myArray = [1, 5, 2, 0, 4, 4];
myArray[2..4]
)
// -&gt; [ 2, 0, 4 ]
</code></pre>
<p>The following tools are also useful â€” I am certain you can figure out how they work from their names
and very brief examples, and if not, you can consult the documentation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-supercollider">["con", "cat"] ++ ["en", "a", "tion"]
newArray = array.copy
array.indexOf(thing)
array.includes(thing)
["heads", "tails"].choose
array.scramble
</code></pre>
<h2 id="iteration"><a class="header" href="#iteration">Iteration</a></h2>
<p>sclang has a rich variety of methods for iterating and filtering arrays. Here is a very terse
summary of them.</p>
<pre><code class="language-supercollider">// Prints numbers 0 through 7 inclusive.
8.do { |i| "i".postln; };

// Remember, 8.do { ... } is just shorthand for 8.do({ ... }).

// Do something for each element. index is optional.
array.do { |elem| ... };
array.do { |elem, index| ... };

// Do something for each element and make a new array from the return values.
// Often called "map" in other environments
var newArray = array.collect { |elem| ... };

// Filter the array and keep only elements for which the given function returns
// true. The function should only return Booleans.
var newArray = array.select { |elem| elem % 2 == 0 };

// Return true iff the function returns true for any/every element.
// The function should only return Booleans.
[1, 2, 3].any { |elem| elem % 2 == 0 }
[1, 2, 3].every { |elem| elem % 2 == 0 }
</code></pre>
<p>These methods don't lazy evaluate on arrays, so chaining them isn't efficient like in functional
programming environments. SC does have native coroutines via the <code>Routine</code> class.</p>
<p>Array methods get the job done most of the time, but <code>while</code> loops are also sometimes necessary:</p>
<pre><code>var x = 3;
while { x &lt; 10 } {
    x.postln;
    x = x + 1;
};

// More idiomatic: (3..9).do { |x| x.postln }
</code></pre>
<p>Loops can be broken out of using the <code>block</code> method, which is exceedingly rare but occasionally
the best option:</p>
<pre><code>block { |break|
    5.do { |i|
        if(i &gt; 3) {
            break.value("hey"); // "hey" is the return value of block { ... }
        };
    };
};
</code></pre>
<h2 id="strings-and-symbols"><a class="header" href="#strings-and-symbols">Strings and symbols</a></h2>
<pre><code class="language-supercollider">"Strings are delimited with double quotes."
"Strings can be
multiline."
"Escape characters: \t \f \v \n \r \\"
</code></pre>
<p>sclang will tolerate non-ASCII bytes in strings, but they are just bytes, and Unicode isn't really
understood. The SCIDE displays UTF-8, so if you're careful, non-ASCII characters will come out
unscathed. Sorry about that.</p>
<p>Strings are effectively immutable arrays of <code>Char</code> objects. <code>Char</code> objects have a literal syntax:
<code>$a</code>.</p>
<p>Symbols are similar to strings, but are efficient when reused, and not so efficient for textual
operations. A symbol is therefore ideal for identifiers that are only meaningful within your
program, while a string is intended for actual text input, manipulation, and output.</p>
<pre><code class="language-supercollider">'Symbols are delimited by single quotes'

// But if the symbol is a valid identifier, there's a much simpler syntax:
\validIdentifier2000
</code></pre>
<p>Here are some useful things to do with strings and symbols â€” any ambiguities can be cleared up by
consulting the docs:</p>
<pre><code class="language-supercollider">// Querying:
"string".size

// Conversion:
"string".asSymbol
\symbol.asString
3.asString
"3".asInteger
"3".asFloat

// Modification:
"concaten" ++ "ation"
"with" + "space" + "in" + "between"
"path/" +/+ "/joining"
"You can format %.".format("strings")
