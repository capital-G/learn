[Verse]

        C                G

Should auld acquaintance be forgot

     Am               F

And never brought to min'?

        C                 G

Should auld acquaintance be forgot

     F       G         C

And days of auld lang syne?



[Refrain]

     C         G

For auld lang syne, my dear

     Am        F

For auld lang syne

       C              G

We'll tak' ae cup o'kindness yet

     F    G     C

For auld lang syne
